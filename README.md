**Face & Hand Landmark Recognition with Gesture Detection**

This project is a real-time face and hand landmark recognition system that uses a desktop webcam to detect human presence,
analyze hand gestures, and identify whether the screen is empty or occupied. 
The application also recognizes common hand gestures and displays the corresponding sign.

**Features**

**How It Works**

>Captures live video input using the desktop webcam

>Detects face and hand landmarks frame-by-frame

>Analyzes hand landmark positions to classify gestures

**Determines:**

>Face + hands present

>Only hands present

>Only face present

>No landmarks detected (empty screen)

**Technologies Used:**

>Python

>OpenCV

>MediaPipe

>NumPy

>Webcam / Computer Vision

This application demonstrates practical use of computer vision and real-time gesture recognition,
enabling intuitive interaction between humans and machines using only a webcam.
